# nads-mxgraph

## Overview

A simple web app that utilizes mxgraph. Here is a link for the online deployment of the app on heroku: https://nads-mxgraph.herokuapp.com/

## how to deploy it locally on your device

To deploy it on your local device after downloading this repository, you must install the mxgraph library in the directory (either directly from the official website or using a package manager such as npm) and set the relative paths within the graph.html file acccordingly

## why does this include a .php file?

That file doesn't actually do anything, Heroku requires that applications have a backend before it deploys them, so that had to be include it.
